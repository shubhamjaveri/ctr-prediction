# ctr-prediction
Predicting ad click-through rates (CTR) is a common machine learning task used in digital advertising to optimize campaigns.
CTR is a crucial metric in online advertising, representing the percentage of users who click on an ad after it's displayed. Accurately predicting CTR allows advertisers to:
•	Optimize ad placement: Target ads to users most likely to click.
•	Improve ad design: Create more engaging and effective ads.
•	Increase ROI: Maximize the return on investment for advertising campaigns.
Several factors influence whether a user clicks on an ad:
•	User characteristics: Demographics, interests, browsing history, device used.
•	Ad characteristics: Relevance to user interests, visual appeal, call to action, ad placement.
•	Contextual factors: Time of day, day of the week, website or app where the ad is displayed.
Machine Learning for CTR Prediction
Machine learning models can analyze vast amounts of data to identify patterns and predict CTR with high accuracy. Common approaches include:
2.	Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective model for binary classification (click or no click).
3.	Decision Trees and Random Forests: Can handle non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
4.	Support Vector Machines (SVM): Effective for high-dimensional data and complex decision boundaries.
5.	Neural Networks: Can learn complex patterns and represent non-linear relationships.
Here's a step-by-step guide with sample code using Python and libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and lightgbm (a popular gradient boosting framework).
